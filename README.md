Here I'm sharing my SQL Interview questions and answers 

-----------------------------------

/*--The LinkedIn Creator team is looking for power creators who use their personal profile as a company 
--or influencer page. 
--This means that if someone's Linkedin page has more followers than all the company they work for, 
--we can safely assume that person is a Power Creator.

--Write a query to return the IDs of these LinkedIn power creators in ascending order.

--Assumptions:

--A person can work at multiple companies.
--In the case of multiple companies, WE NEED TO DO SUM OF ALL THE COMPANY'S FOLLOWERS.*/
